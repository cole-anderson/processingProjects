  2) ALL SOUNDS SOURCED FROM: (didnt use any sound)

  3) GAMEFREAK(pokemon) assets used under the pre-tense of
      fair use. (my creation is transformative in nature)


CONTEXT FOR THE GAME:
1) THE THREE STARTERS SYMBOLIZE: ALIENS, PSYCICS/FATE, BLACK CATS (ALL THINGS PEOPLE ARE SUPERSTITIOS ABOUT)
2) COYOTES ON A JOURNEY ARE CONSIDERING BAD LUCK (AND THE PLAYER IS ON A POKEMON JOURNEY)
3) The tower is haunted
