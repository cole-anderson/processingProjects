/*
  This project was inspired by the fact I often find my meditation/calmness/ignoring troubles
  while playing video games. But I understand that sometimes videogames can be actually a not meditating
  and instead stressful and frustrating event. When I really want to calmly play video games I often
  play a single player game with cheats/mods enabled that make frustrating experiences less so 
  and allow me to fully become on with the story taking place. These are in the forms of "god mode"
  "infinite ammo" or "hacked weapons" that make the experience of playing much more of an escape rather
  then another thing to get me upset. My secondary inspiration was the fact that when its not for school
  I really do enjoy coding even the process of troubleshooting some errors. Its in the process of working
  on a personal project as a learning experience with no strings attatched that I am truly passionate about
  and while I understand the reality of my career will be pressures and deadlines to fix or create code
  there is something very calming and fufilling solving problems while coding. 
  So combining the two of theses I created "error invaders". No loss condition, purpose is to defeat space invaders
  or in this case errors. The asthetic I went for was a more minimalist style as the original space invaders was but found
  it more easy to understand if the aliens(errors) were text rather then ambiguous ascii art of errors. Majority of my focus
  was on the game itself in processing and then following this using the arduino more as an input and response related device
  (ie joystick+button input, screen and light output for my discrete input and outputs).
